	<div>
		<h2>A little about who we are and how it all got started</h2>
		<p>CDI GSI Consulting was created by just three people; three students who joined forces for a project in a class called "Web Design and Programming". 
			They felt that GIS and drones were pretty cool so why not make a company for it? Plus, they all had a nifty Basics Operations license to fly drones.
			The three of them felt that they should at least put it to good use.
